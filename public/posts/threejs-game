This past week I've been making a Spider-Man game with Three.js. The tools I used include:

- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (for modeling)
- React Three [Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction), [DREI](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei), and [Rapier](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-rapier) (coding)
- [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/) (for importing animations)

I got some inspiration for a quick Three.js game from Andy Chung's [self-portrait](https://andychung.me/self-portrait), which involved a WASD-based movement system with some simple animations. For my game I knew I wanted something similar, and decided to model Insomniac Games' newest Spider-Man model, the Advanced Suit 2.0.

I started everything by modeling a low-poly model. I found a good [reference](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/marvel-spider-man-ps4-for-blender-517d2274e86f4a4ebe14d8cdb1ab32f6) of the character from the 2018 game, and got started (adjusting slightly to fit the new model). Once I was in a good place, I colored it in by using different materials.

After this I rigged the character and added some of my own animations. I started coding and set out a first-draft scene: Spider-Man walking on a plane, navigating to where the user clicked. I added a fixed camera hovering above the scene, and placed Spider-Man in the middle. This wasn't too hard, but it did involve a lot of trial and error. Here's what it looked like in the end:

This was great! However the animation was too stiff, so I decided to scrap everything (except the model) and restart. This involved setting up a new scene, with proper WASD controls this time, and using animations from a site called [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/). After this, I had the following scene:

To store which animation Spider-Man was using, I used a game engine called [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), which allowed me to set the animation to either "Idle" or "Run". I created a Canvas component, and placed this skeleton inside:

```javascript
function Game() {
  const map = useMemo(() => [
    { name: Controls.forward, keys: ["ArrowUp", "KeyW"] },
    { name: Controls.back, keys: ["ArrowDown", "KeyS"] },
    { name: Controls.left, keys: ["ArrowLeft", "KeyA"] },
    { name: Controls.right, keys: ["ArrowRight", "KeyD"] },
    { name: Controls.jump, keys: ["Space"] },
  ]);
  return (
    <KeyboardControls map={map}>
      <Canvas
        shadows
        camera={{ position: [0, 6, 4], fov: 42 }}
        style={{ height: "100vh" }}
      >
        <Suspense>
          <Physics>
            <Experience />
          </Physics>
        </Suspense>
      </Canvas>
    </KeyboardControls>
  );
}
```

My game ([code here](https://github.com/jerryliangxia/portfolio)) was placed in the [Experience](https://github.com/jerryliangxia/portfolio/blob/main/src/components/game/Experience.js) component.

For the character controller, I asked for WASD/directional arrowcontrols from the user, and applied a `react-three-rapier` impulse based on the direction of the character. Since my camera was only facing one direction, this was relatively straightforward. The camera would also follow the player (`character.current.getWorldPosition`), and use LERP (linear interpolattion) to make Spider-Man look where he was going.

I used a library called `gltfjsx` to help me load in the `.glb` files from my project. This involved a single command;

```javascript
npx gltfjsx path/to/file/file_name.glb
```

which created a `.jsx` file with all the Mesh, Plane and other components necessary from the source `.glb` file. This was super useful in importing my scene and character.

After this it was all about creating a surrounding scene. I decided to have Oscorp tower in the background, with three buildings Spider-Man could have access to. I added some colliders (with Rapier, I had to manually adjust the position of each one), and finished the scene up with three new props: Harry Osborn's research center, an Oscorp radio tower, and a wooden water tower. These were all classic elements of the first game!

Three.js has no 3D viewport (although I found [this](https://triplex.dev/) later), so it was a bit tedious to figure out where to place each collider; but definitely worth it. Here's a screenshot of the final result:
