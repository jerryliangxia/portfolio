While working at Unity I attended several of their game dev nights, where I worked on a game called Lightspeed. You can play it here for free on [itch.io](https://jerrylxia.itch.io/lightspeed). This post is dedicated to my process while making the game.

I first had the idea for my game in March of this year, waking up in the middle of the night to take my phone and jot down what I thought was possible with the game.

- The game involves you, a spaceship, trying to maneuver around planets come at you from the center. I wanted to focus on a camera that would pan in and out based on your position away from the center, creating a cool speed effect. I planned on making it story based, like [Exo One](https://store.steampowered.com/app/773370/Exo_One/), but decided to go with a high score game.

My first game dev night was somewhere back in May; the second week after I joined. I had no experience with Unity whatsoever; in my day job as an intern I touched on C#, which may have helped. I used ChatGPT for a lot of my first scripts. However, I was able to get a working prototype that looked like the phone-recorded image you see below:

Adding the projectile spitter (that's what I named it for a long time: `ProjectileSpitter`) was simple, and I got used to a lot of Unity's built-in functionalities like Colliders and RigidBodies. I found myself digging for a long time in scripts, while I in fact had to toggle a button on a Collider and what I wanted would work. After that came the scene changing, where I worked on persisting music, game over screens and menu screens. Here's the title screen, and a quick demo of things so far on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSYpp_IxKGM).

I then decided on how I should make the player obtain a score. I decided on creating 'levels', where the only way you could advance to the next level is by coming in close contact with outcoming planets. The closer you are, the more you progress to the next level.

This was it. Other than that, I added a logarithmic scale for game difficulty, and got some pretty nice sound effects made for my game. I added in some non-copyright music, spent a long time figuring out scenes, persisting music, and a main menu. Here's a screen cap of some gameplay:

And a v1.0 demo here:
