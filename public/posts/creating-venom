After completing Insomniac's [Spider-Man 2](https://insomniac.games/game/marvels-spider-man-2/), I created my own low-poly version of Venom from the game. I wanted to use this model in my `/game` section of the site, and make him look intimidating.

I started by using my original Spider-Man model, which I wrote about in my blog [here](https://jerryxia.com/blog/threejs-game), and inflated him using Blender's sculpt tool.

To get the character proportions right, I used the Hot Toys' 1:1 model of Venom (seen in the bakcground above), and got the following:

However, he was too skinny. I needed a suit in a man, not a man in a suit! So I tried with several reference images -- finding details, reiterating, finding more details, and trying again.

Tweaking the size of his arms, chest, groin, buttocks and other large and slimy parts, I got this:

Finally, I imported animations from Mixamo, and included it as a `.glb` file in my scene.

I later attended some tendrils to simulate the final act of the game.

## Creating a full version

A few days later I decided to tackle creating a full version of Venom, starting from the low-poly base. I took several reference images this time:

After separating the logo and applying the same material to the eyes and body as my Symbiote mask (seen in my 3D section), I got the following:

Venom's spider logo, along with his eyes, needed some closer attention. Using the Paint tool, I was able to add some small details, such as black lines and a dark perimeter surrounding the eyes.

Then, using Blender's sculpt tool I added in more defined musculature - his abs, thigh and arm muscles, as well as his shoulders, hands and feet. Here's the result in Solid view:

And with materials:

After rigging with Mixamo and applying an idle animation, I got the following:

Venom is shown in full detail on my [3D page](https://jerryxia.com/3d); feel free to check him out.
