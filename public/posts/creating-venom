After completing Insomniac's [Spider-Man 2](https://insomniac.games/game/marvels-spider-man-2/), I created my own low-poly version of Venom from the game. I wanted to use this model in my `/game` section of the site, and make him look intimidating.

I started by using my original Spider-Man model, which I wrote about in my blog [here](https://jerryxia.com/blog/threejs-game), and inflated him using Blender's sculpt tool.

To get the character proportions right, I used the Hot Toys' 1:1 model of Venom (seen in the background above), and got the following:

However, he was too skinny -- I needed a suit in a man, not a man in a suit. I continued with several reference images -- finding details, reiterating, finding more details, reiterating.

After tweaking his various parts, I got this:

Finally, I imported animations from Mixamo, and converted my `.blend` to a `.glb` for my scene.

I then attended some tendrils to simulate the final act of the game.

## Creating a full model

Shortly after I tackled creating a full version of Venom, starting from his low-poly base.

The first step was to remove the whites from his body, as well as his gums and tongue. I applied the same slimy material as my Symbiote mask (seen in my 3D section), and got the following:

Some obvious details were missing. Venom's arms looked like large blobs compared to what you see in-game. Also, his white spider and eyes lack the detail to be deemed realistic. To get the full definition of his build, I took several reference images from the game:

Using the Paint tool, I was able to add some small details to his whites, such as black lines, scratches and a shadow on the edges of his eyes.

Then, using Blender's sculpt tool I added in more defined muscles - as well as more detail to his hands and feet. Here's the result in Solid view:

And after applying materials:

After rigging with Mixamo and applying an idle animation, I got the following:

Venom is shown in full detail on my [3D page](https://jerryxia.com/3d); feel free to check him out.
