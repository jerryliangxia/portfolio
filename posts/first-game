While working at Unity I attended several of their game dev nights, where I worked on a game called Lightspeed. You can play it here for free on [itch.io](https://jerrylxia.itch.io/lightspeed). This post is dedicated to my process making the game.

I first had the idea for my game in March of this year, waking up in the middle of the night to jot down my ideas.

- The game involves you, a spaceship, maneuvering around planets that come at you from the center. If you hit on, you die. If you get close to one, you increase your score. I wanted to focus on a camera that would pan in and out based on your position from the center, creating a cool movement effect. Originally I planned to make it story-based ([Exo One](https://store.steampowered.com/app/773370/Exo_One/) was an inspiration) but then decided to go with a high score game.

Adding the planet launcher was simple, and I got used to a lot of Unity's built-in functionalities. After that came the scene changing, where I worked on persisting music, game over screens and menu screens. Here's the title screen:

And a screenshot of things so far:

I added a logarithmic scale for game difficulty, and got some pretty nice sound effects made for my game. I added in some non-copyright music, ensured persisting music, and a main menu. Here's a GIF of some gameplay:
