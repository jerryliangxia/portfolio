This past summer, I got used to a tool called [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and an AI-assisted animation tool called [Cascadeur](https://cascadeur.com/).

On July 29, 2023, a YouTuber called [Pwnisher](https://www.youtube.com/@pwnisher) (former [Corridor Crew](https://www.youtube.com/@CorridorCrew) member) uploaded [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tof8Pm-qpZw) about a "3D Boss Fight" challenge that only had four rules:

I thought I'd do a Spider-Man animation. The animation part seemed the most fun, so I got started on that first. I already had a sequence in mind: Peter's hand-web-swap swing from Spider-Man (2018) by Insomniac Games. I opened up Cascadeur (which I discovered through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKwDf5MH-LY&t=57s)) and started keyframing; I used [this model](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/spider-man-v2-read-caption-d33cd6afe5bd47e59ccda1c893a25b74) from Sketchfab, and after removing some bones I could import it into Cascadeur. Check this out!

The AI-assisted keyframing in Cascadeur allows other bones to move if you much just one (or any amount). This made the animation process fast, and after around 100 or so keyframes I had this (40s):

I was now ready to import this into Blender. It took a while to reassign the armature to Blender's [Rigify](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.81/addons/rigging/rigify.html) add-on, but the process was relatively straightforward.

I added a Bezier curve that Spider-Man could follow, used Blender's [NLA strips](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/nla/strips.html) to split and scale (slow down) frames of the imported animation, and got the following result:

I added a simple portal effect using a particle system, and found it was pretty similar to that of Unity's. I decided to make the "boss" Oscorp Tower, which emitted a portal of light into the sky (I wanted it to look like this [Avengers scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9bNkQndkNw)). After playing around for a bit, adding a foreground, water and night sky, I got this:

I decided this didn't look good enough (asking for feedback my brother called the effect "cheap" lol) so I decided to learn Blender's [Geometry Nodes](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/index.html) to make a better portal effect. This gave more of an impression that something evil was opening in the sky.

I was also on my way to Vancouver at the time, so I worked the entire time on the airplane there. On the flight, I added several clouds to the background (imported with the [Images as Planes](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/import_export/images_as_planes.html) add-on), a bridge, volumetric fog, a buoy (try to find it!) and a rotated, much cooler looking portal effect:

Although I didn't make the Top 100, I am featured in this ALL RENDERS montage video at `3:00:14`:

I also made a YouTube breakdown video that documented my process. You can view it here:

This challenge was incredibly fun and rewarding; I haven't had more fun in a software, since, ever. It also touched so many areas of expertise - animation, modeling, VFX and texture painting, too. Since I plan to learn more Blender with the days to come, this was definitely helpful in accelerating the process. On to making better animations!

Thanks for reading :)
