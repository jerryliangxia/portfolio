Today I made a quick 3D game, which involves the player moving across four areas:

- Starting area
- Combat zone
- Canyon area
- Goal area

This was part of COMP 521: Modern Computer Games, and was the first assignment in the course.

Following a brief altercation with Unity's Package Import ([check this forum](https://forum.unity.com/threads/i-lost-all-of-my-scene-assets-after-scene-reload.978981/)) I lost all my progress when I finished the project. However I thought I'd take advantage of the situation and do a timelapse of the whole process!
