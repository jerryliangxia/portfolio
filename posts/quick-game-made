Today I made a quick 3D game (~2h), which involves the player moving across four areas:

- Starting area
- Combat zone
- Canyon area
- Goal area

This was part of COMP 521: Modern Computer Games, and was the first assignment in the course.

Following a brief altercation with Unity's Package Import 🙃 ([full problem on this forum here](https://forum.unity.com/threads/i-lost-all-of-my-scene-assets-after-scene-reload.978981/)) I lost all my progress at the end of the project. BUT I thought I'd take advantage of the situation and do a timelapse of the whole process!
