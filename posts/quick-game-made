Today I made a quick game (~2h), which features the player moving around four areas: a starting area, combat zone, canyon area and goal area. This was part of COMP 521: Modern Computer Games, and was the first assignment in the course.

Following a brief altercation with Unity's Package Import ðŸ™ƒ ([full problem on this forum here](https://forum.unity.com/threads/i-lost-all-of-my-scene-assets-after-scene-reload.978981/)) I lost all my progress withstood in the past three hours. So I thought I'd take the advantage to do the whole thing again, but with the knowledge of what I'd done before and a nice timelapse I could upload and show on YouTube. Here's that video:

I originally lost all my progress because of a WebGL issue, but I'm now happy to say that the game is deployed [here](https://jerrylxia.itch.io/a-nice-walk) on itch.io if you'd like to check it out :) (Playtime: ~2 mins)
